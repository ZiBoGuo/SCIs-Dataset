# spacecraft component images(SCIs) segmentation dataset
This newly created dataset contains 8833 simulated spacecraft images, with 7061 images designated for training and the remaining 1772 for testing. The dataset spans 26 different image resolutions, ranging from 90x82 to 1015x1015. It encompasses 16 diverse spacecraft types and five crucial feature component types: Panel, Antenna, Thruster, Optical load, and Mechanical arm.

This dataset references the VOC2007 dataset format and contains ImageSets, JPEGImages, and SegmentationClass folders. The JPEGImages folder contains the original images, the SegmentationClass folder contains the labeled images, and the txt file identifies the image names for training, testing, and validation.
